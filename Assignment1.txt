Implementation of ENCAPSULATION, ABSTRACTION, POLYMORPHISM and INHERITANCE are explained below

- ENCAPSULATION

A private and a public variables are made in Parent class. In Assignment1 class, public variable is directly accesible. 
But to access private variable, getter and setter functions are used.


- ABSTRACTION

Abstract class Animal is used with abstract method "legs". So this method has to be overridden by non-abstract sub class. 
Duck and cheetah are 2 non abstract child classes of Animal. These implement legs method according to their own. 
Since Animal is abstract, its instance cannot be directly created. Instances of subclasses are created and treated as Animal objects. 
Same method legs is implemented using 2 objects. 


- POLYMORPHISM

1. Method overloading - Two functions defined in parent class with same name numbers but different parameters. 
They both are executed in the main method.

2. Method Overriding - Parent is the parent class and Assignment1 is its child class. Both classes have same function. 
If child class object is created and the method is executed, if child class has the method too, it will override, else parent class's method will be executed.


INHERITANCE

1. Single Inheritance
Assignment1 class's object can access both methods from its class and parents class.

2. Multilevel Inheritance
Parent is parent class of Brother class. Brother class is the parent of BKid class. 
So BKidclass's object can access methods from its class, Brother class, and also Parent class. 

3. Hierarchial Inheritance
Both Brother and Sister classes have same parent class Parent.So both objects can acces methods from parent's class
